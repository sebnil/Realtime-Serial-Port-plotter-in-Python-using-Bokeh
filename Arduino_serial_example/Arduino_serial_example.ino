/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the Uno and
  Leonardo, it is attached to digital pin 13. If you're unsure what
  pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the documentation at http://www.arduino.cc

  This example code is in the public domain.

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

void loop() {
  i++;
  Serial.write(i);
  delay(100);
